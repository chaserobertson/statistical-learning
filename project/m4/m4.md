# Goal
The goal of this project is to investigate the impact of the February 2021 Residential Tenancies Amendment Bill by observing changing rental trends on the New Zealand housing market.

# Data Source
The data is sourced from the NZ Tenancy Services [website](https://www.tenancy.govt.nz/about-tenancy-services/data-and-statistics/rental-bond-data). Three CSV files are provided with territorial, regional, and quarterly aggregate bond statistics. In order to translate Location Id's from the quarterly dataset into location names, it is also necessary to retrieve data from the Stats NZ [site](https://datafinder.stats.govt.nz/layer/98770-statistical-area-2-2019-centroid-true/).

# Data Processing
One of the first data processing tasks is to ensure each data column is imported as the correct type, to ensure proper usage later in the analysis. 



Some of the ".Bond" and ".Rent" columns of each dataset import as character-type columns, which does not match their numeric contents. I found that removing the thousands-delimiting commas made converting to integer type possible.


```r
# remove comma from numeric values and convert columns
library(tidyverse)
q2 <- quarterly %>%
    replace_na(list(Location.Id=-1)) %>%
    mutate(across(str_subset(names(quarterly), 
                             regex(".Bond|(n|e).Rent|.Id")),
                  function(x) {as.integer(gsub(',', '', x))}))
```

The next data processing step is to convert the `Time Frame` column into more useful `year` and `quarter` columns. The `lubridate` library makes that a simple task.



I also joined the Stats NZ location ID and location name columns with the quarterly report, so that location names could be easily included in future analysis. It was necessary to manually add ID `-99` to get the location name `"ALL"` to join correctly.


```r
fname <- "statistical-area-2-2019-centroid-true"
fpath <- paste0("../data/statsnz", fname, "-CSV/", fname, ".csv")

# import and join location names
areas <- read.csv(fpath)
locations <- areas %>%
    mutate(ID = SA22019_V1_00) %>%
    mutate(Location = SA22019_V1_00_NAME) %>%
    dplyr::select(ID, Location)
all_locations <- rbind(locations, list(-99, 'ALL'))
q.df <- left_join(q3, all_locations, by=c('Location.Id' = 'ID'))
```

A similar set of steps were followed to import the regional and territorial datasets as well, as can also be seen in the Appendix.





# Data Exploration

The first area of the data explored is the active bond numbers before and after the two-phase Bill implementation in August 2020 and February 2021, searching for any patterns that may change around those dates.



![](m4_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-8-1.pdf)<!-- --> 

There does seem to be some unexpected change through 2021, which suggests some effect, or perhaps some external factor. Let's check the number of Total and Closed Bonds as well.

![](m4_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-9-1.pdf)<!-- --> 

It seems that both Closed and Lodged Bonds follow a similar annual pattern, though with some difference toward the beginning and end of the year. The obvious indicators here are the severe dips in April of 2020 and Aug/Sep of 2021, probably related to the level 4 COVID lockdowns which occurred around those times. It is interesting to note the months of 2022 so far: both Closed and Lodged bond numbers are down relative to previous years. This could mean that there is less moving between residences by renters, as opposed to less residences on the market.

Let's see if any overall patterns differ across dwelling types.

![](m4_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-10-1.pdf)<!-- --> 

Again, it seems that COVID lockdowns in Q2 2020 and Q3 2021 caused a significant perturbation to bond filings, making any effects from the Bill more difficult to distinguish. However, the monthly regional data may help further expose any varying patterns by location.

![](m4_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-11-1.pdf)<!-- --> 

Auckland, Canterbury, Waikato, and Wellington demonstrate an upward trend before the Bill, and a downward trend afterward. Those regions also harbor the largest cities in New Zealand, which begs the question: is this a pattern correlated with urban environments? Could this be an "urban flight" phenomenon caused by COVID-19, rather than changes to rental conditions caused by the Bill?

There may be too many territories to manage in one plot, but it's worth a try to see if any patterns can be gleaned at that level.

![](m4_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-12-1.pdf)<!-- --> 

# Analytical Plan
Based on the information illuminated in the data exploration, it seems that the effects of the Bill have varied to some small degree across dwelling types and to a great degree across locations. One potential path of analysis is constructing a paired t-test to see if there is a statistically significant difference between those bond measures in the time periods before and after the Bill. Perhaps a better way to test that hypothesis is to attempt to infer correlation from a Bayesian structural time-series model. By building a Bayesian model from the data before the Bill's implementation, we can attempt to predict the data after the Bill, and compare those predictions with the actual data to infer the Bill's effect. Yet another way could be to conduct the same analysis with a Random Forest or naive seasonality model.

# Results

Below, a Random Forest model trained on all regional monthly data before 2021 (year, month and Location variables), predicts the number of Closed.Bonds in each location. Because it is the same model for all locations, it is not able to capture the varying seasonality of each location individually. Even so, it gives a fair baseline for how predictive models may or may not be able to give an accurate comparison to the data witnessed since before COVID in 2020.

![](m4_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-13-1.pdf)<!-- --> 

Other models that may give some insight to the effects of the 2021 Bill are a naive seasonal model and, likely more effective, Double-Seasonal Holt-Winters forecasting. These models are trained on data between the years 2000 and 2020 (or 2021 in the case of `DSHW_2`), and their predictions plotted alongside the actual Closed Bonds data since 2020 below. Only Auckland is displayed, as modelling more locations would rapidly become unmanageable, and any change in pattern in Auckland would affect a larger number of residents than in other regions.

![](m4_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-14-1.pdf)<!-- --> 

The more sophisticated models are less accurate than the naive model, because they expect the number of Active Bonds to continue growing with a similar seasonality as previous years. The split actually tracks well with the Bill's second phase in February of 2021, with the late 2020 downturn accounted for by past seasonality. This suggests some change to Auckland's market, though attributing sole causality to the Bill remains impossible.

Perhaps a more informative model is attempted below: a Bayesian Structural Time Series Model.

![](m4_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-15-1.pdf)<!-- --> 

The Bayesian model tracks a similar upward trend to that of previous years, but also provides a 90% confidence interval. As illustrated by the gray band in the above graph, the actual number of Active Bonds in Auckland has never strayed beyond what can be attributed to random changes in the market. Further modeling and hypothesis testing is still necessary to understand what this means in terms of the Bill.

One issue with the modelling thus far is autocorrelation: each time-series data point is correlated with the one previous to it. Below, a logarithmic scale is applied to month-over-month changes to the number of Active Bonds, and the log results are transformed back into positive and negative numbers. By applying a linear regression to these transformed values, the same underlying Active Bonds data can be seen in a new light.

![](m4_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-16-1.pdf)<!-- --> 

Another model I thought might provide some insight to this data is changepoint detection. The below plot shows the Auckland Active Bonds data overlayed with several iterations of the changepoint model, each with a different number of points specified. Comparing the Bill's implementation dates with the clusters of changepoints detected, there is again some suggestion that the Bill or its contemporary national issues have impacted the rental market in some negative way.

# Discussion

It is fantastic that NZ Tenancy Services provides this rental data to the public. It is clean and thorough, and provides universal ground truth for discussions about policy effectiveness. In this case, however, the data is insufficient to prove any claims about the Tenancy Bill, because of the incredibly confounding factor of COVID-19, among other things. Causality simply cannot be proven to any degree in an observational analysis such as this. With finding patterns in this data being the goal of this project, it has actually been quite satisfying to iterate on different models and methods of analysis and ultimately discover the patterns presented here.
